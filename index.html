        <h3>Who I Am</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">I'm Oscar Bower a 17 year old from Sheffield, curently I attend All Saints catholic High School where I'm studying Mathematics, Further Mathematics And Computer Science at A-level. After completing my a-levels I intend to undertake a Computer Science degree at university. I'm hoping to successfully apply to either Manchester or Durham university and am unsure about which to choose between a Bsc(Bachelors) or a Meng(Bachelors with integrated masters). I actively seek ways to improve and have a strong desire to be the absolute best I can be whether that be in theoretical knowledge or practical skills. At the the moment I have my eyes set on working in the tech industry and am hoping that university level work will give a much clearer inkling into what specific fields of computing there are within the workplace.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">In my spare time I play a lot of games ranging from Minecraft to Civilization VI to Total War Warhammer III. I am an avid reader and easily find myself lost in books and it's a common occurrence for me to read for around 3 hours before going to bed. I also spend time messing around with and learning programming languages and am planning to learn JavaScript along with HTML and CSS so that I can learn React which is a lot more abstracted and commonly-used in the industry. I enjoy working out at the gym and feel proud of the progress I've made since starting to regularly workout.</p>
