            <h3>Time Management</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Having spent much of Y12 and Y13 balancing School, Independent study, Gym and Freetime I'm proficient at managing time effieciently which allows me to plan out when and how to approach tasks of varying lengths and difficulty</p>
        </div>
        <div class="smallBox basicCodeBox">
            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Having worked in the catering industry I understand the importance of good communication between co-workers and that ensuring everyone is aware of tasks that require completing ultimately makes the workload easier and improves efficiency in the workplace</p>
        </div>
        <div class="smallBox basicCodeBox">
            <h3>Perseverance and Determination</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Whether in school or in my free time I enjoy challenging myself and trying to improve what I'm capable of. I have a positive approach to difficult tasks as I strongly believe that it is only when faced with difficulty that we can improve our skills</p>

        <div class="smallBox basicCodeBox">
            <h3>Punctuality</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Although not a skill I strongly believe that punctuality is a crucial quality to have and that it can be a direct representation of the amount of time and effort someone is willing to commit in the workplace. as a consequence of this belief I always ensure that I arrive on time to fulfil my responsibilities</p>            
        </div>
        <div class="smallBox basicCodeBox">
            <h3>Diligence</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">I enjoy putting my all into what I do and am passionate about being the best I can. This is reflected in my actions when I work where I will persistently ask if anything needs doing or actively seek tasks to do as I feel that this makes me a better employee</p>
        </div>
        <div class="smallBox basicCodeBox">
            <h3>Team work</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Another skill learned from working in the catering industry, being able to pick up slack in the workplace to help maintain productivity is essential to the business' success and I take pride in being able to help where the team is struggling as not only can it maintain worker morale but also avoid bad service due to wait times and incorrect orders</p>
